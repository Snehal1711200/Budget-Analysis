The Budget Data Analysis Project focuses on collecting, organizing, and analyzing financial data related to planned and actual income and expenses over a defined period.
The objective is to identify spending patterns, track variances between budgeted and actual figures, uncover cost-saving opportunities, and support strategic financial planning.
Through visual dashboards, trend analysis, and variance reports, this project enables better decision-making, improves financial efficiency, and helps maintain control over financial goals.
